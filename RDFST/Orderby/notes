This is the notes for ORDER BY clause

We are going to learn how to sort data in sql queries
by default when we call a select from query by default it is going to 
order them by their ID 

We can change this default sortment by using ORDER BY clause
The reason for this is because the customer id column is the 
primary key for this table 

In relational databases every table should have a primary key column 
and the values in that column should uniquely identify the records in that table

ORDER BY:
to sort a table by another column we would use the clause 
so if we wanted to sort the table by the first name 
Now we can see that the results are not sorted by the ID 
but by alphabetical acesnding order to do the reverse
add DESC

we can also sort multiple columns
so we are going to sort by state and within the state sort by the customers first name 
we can use the DESC argument anywhere in the statement 
so we atre going to DESC the state and then sort them by the name 

An important thing to know that makes SQL different from 
other database management systems is MYSQL 
can sort any columns whether that column is in 
the select clause or not

so if we wanted to select the first and last name for the customers 
now we can sort the result by any columns in this tble 
so we can sort it by the birthdate

Other database management systems will sometimes yell at us
when we write a query like this 

We can also sort data by an alias
again in mysql we can get away with something like this 

One last thing we need to go over
In certain tutorials show us how to sort data by columns positions 
we can order by 1 and 2
this basically means we sort data by the first and last name 

While this approach works its something that we should avoid
because in the future if edit this query and add another column to the front 
the customers are no londer sorted in the previous order 

The thing to take away from this is that sorting data by column positions 
produces unexpected results and is something that we should avoid

try to sort by column names 

-- Exercise:
-- In the order_items table 
-- write a query to:
-- Select all items for order with ID 2
-- sort by total price (quantity * unit price)
-- In descending order 

Remember when we are sorting using order by we do not 
have to use a column name we can use Arithmetic expressions 
aliases
