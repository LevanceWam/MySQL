How to Retrieve data from a table

One thing we need to understand that is that if our tables are not bold 
that means that they are not up for querying 

So we are going to use the sql_store dataBase 

to do this we need to use the keyword  USE 
SQL is not a case sensitive language but it is 
best pratice to have the key words capitalize
we have to terminate it at the end with a ; or else we are going to get an error

we can also select an database by double clicking it 

we are going to write a query to retrieve all of the customers
this is a job for the select statement 

SELECT statement:
-- in front of it we Specify the columns we want to retrieve
-- we use * for all columns

FROM clause:
-- this is used to pick the table we want to query

So the select statement has 2 clauses the select clause and the from clause 
but there are other clauses we can use to filter and sort data

WHERE clause:
-- this clause can filter the result

ORDER BY:
-- we can sort the data using this clause 
-- this is where we specify the column that we want the results on 

** this is something that we need to take away from this 
These 3 clauses are optional
Just know that in the real word that we are always using them and 
that the order of the clauses are very important

We can not change the order of this because this will give us a syntax error

Also as a heads up all of the white spaces and tabs are ingored when we are executing sql statements
so we can have all of our clauses on one line and it won't cause a 
problem

But as the query gets more complex it is better to 
put each clause on a new line
