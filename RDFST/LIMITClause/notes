This is the notes for LIMIT clause 

We are going to look into limiting the amount 
of records we get back from the query

So normally when we execute a query like selecting all of the 
customers we get all of the customers
But what if we only wanted to get lets say 3 or 5
this is where we can use the LIMIT clause

LIMIT Clause:
under the from clause 
we add LIMIT and the number we wish to set
if the number goes over the amount of records that the query can produce
it will show the ones that we have 

next to the clause we can pass a offset this is good if we 
want to paginate the data
so if we had a site that allowed us to see the customers on each page 
and on each page will have 3 customers 
page 1 will have 1 - 3 and page 2: 2- 6 and etc

lets try to get customers for page 3
so we add a number in front of the the number of records we want returned
this is a offset this tells MySQL to skip a number of records 

Exercise: 
Get the top 3 loyal customers 
These customers have the most points 

Important Note:
The LIMIT clause should always come at the end

The order of our clauses matter and if we change the order MySQL is going to yell at us 
So we have to pay attention to the order 

Order:
SELECT
FROM 
WHERE 
ORDER BY
LIMIT
