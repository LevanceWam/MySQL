This is the notes for Where Clause

The where clause is used to filter data
so if we wanted to get the customers with points greater than 3000
we can accomplish that

When we execute this query the query execution engine 
in MySQL is going to iterate over all the customers in the customers table 
for each customer it is going to evulate this condition 
if it's true we are going to return the customer in the result set

notice that we used the > operator to accomplish this task 
Here are the other operators we can use:
>
>=
<
<=
=
!= and <> are the same, these are not equal

lets try another example lets get all of the customers that are from VA

We can use the comparsion operators with date values also
Note when we are comparing datas we have to use '' to represent the 
data values even though they aren't strings 

But in the SQL language we should enclose dates with quotes
This is the default format for dates in SQL 
year/month/date the year has to be 4 digits, month 2 and day is also 2

Time for a exercise:
We need to write a query to get the orders that are placed this year
so from the orders table figure out how to accomplish this 

Solution notes:

We got the query right but here are some things to take in consideration

we HAVE to write out the date for the query to execute just writting one part 
of the date is going to give us a error

Another thing wrong with the implementation is that 
we hard coded the current year if the year changes this code is incorrect
later we are going to learn how to deal with this
