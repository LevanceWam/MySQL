This is the notes for SelectClause 

Looking at the select clause in more detail
Remeber we can choose the database we are querying by double 
clicking it so we can remove the USE at the top as well as the WHERE and ORDER BY 

What can we dpo with the select clause 

Now remember that the * means return all of the columns 
or we can pick the ones we want 

this is helpful in some situations because if we have a big table 
with lots of columns and millions of records
Bring back all of that data is going to put a lot
of pressure on the database server 
in this case MYSQL as well as the network

this is why we explicitly call the columns we want to get 
depending on how we place the columnns next to the select is how it is going to print at the bottom

we are going to add another column called points

Now lets say we want to take the points nd put them in a 
mathematical format to calculate the discount we give to each customer 

we can use arithmetic expressions to change the value of the points
this creates a new column with the calculated value

in this arithmetic expression we need to understand the order of operators
this is based on order of operations in math 

we can give this new column a alias by using the keyword AS 
currently we have a underscore seperating it but if we wanted to 
use a space instead we have to surround it using "" 


now we are going to do something 

we are going to select the state column from customers
in this db we do not have any dups

we are going to create one so in the customer table we are going to 
change the first customer from MA to VA 

now in the bottom right corner we are going to see the 
apply and revert button 
we are going to hit apply

This pulls up a dialog box to review the changes 
we are going to apply it

Here's something cool 
lets say that we want to get a unique list of results
of results?

This is where we would use the DISTINCT keyword

with the current query well retrieve a unqiue list of states
from the customer table ans this helps us remove the dups 


Exercise:
we need to write a queryt that is going to return all of the products
then we are going ti want to see 3 columns 
the name, unit price and a unit price with a arithmetic expression * 1.1

Solution notes:

Need to be careful with the wording of the exercise 
it code have implied to use the * next to SELECT to get all of the 
product but that not the case 

A we need to do is to select the columns that we wanted from products and that is
