This is the notes for IN operator

Starting with an Example:

Lets say we wanted to get the customers that were located in VA FL and GA
one way to do this is to use the OR operator 
but the thing with that is it can be a little verbose 
as it is used to combine multiple conditions 

to make this shorter we can use the in operator
the query that is written now is equivalent to the
or operators we where using to get the same result 

Also if we wanted to get the customers that are not in this state all we have to do is 
use the NOT operator

We use the IN operator when we want to compare
an attribute to a list of values 

Exercise:

Write a query to get products where the quantity in stock 
equals one of these values:
49, 38, 72
