This is the notes for NULL Operator

We are going to look into finding records that are 
missing a attribute

So for example if we select all of the customers in the database 
one customer doesnt have a phone number and it has null in its place 

NULL means the absence of a value 
Lets say we want to search for the customers that dont have a phone 
and we would want to send a email to them that they are missing a phone in the system

This is where we would use the IS NULL Operator
we can also use NOT to get people with a phone 

Exercise: 
-- Get the orders that are not shipped
