This is the notes for LIKE Operator

We are going to learn how to retrieve rows to
match a specific string pattern,

For Example Lets say we only want to get 
Customers with the last name that starts b

so in the query we are going to use the LIKE operator to help us find the Customers
that meet these conditions 

Using %:

notice that after the b we have a % 
this is used to indicate the numbers of charaters after the B 
so we can have 1 or none or more 

The % doesn't always have to be at the end of the string

Using _:
by using _ and lets say y so _y
we are saying that 
we want to get customers who's name is exactly 2 charaters long
we do not care what the first charaters is but as long as the second one y

But depending on the amount of _ we have this will check for that amount of characters
So if we have 5 _ and a y we are going took for names that are 6 characters long and ends in y

Recap:
%: represents any number of characters 
_: represents a single character 

LIKE is a little outdated 
and we have a more powerful operator to search through our strings 

Exercise 
Get customers whose:
Address contain trail or AVENUE
phone numbers end in 9
