This is the notes for REGEXP Operator

Lets say that we wanted to sarch the customers 
who have the word field in their last name 

We could use the LIKE operator here and be fine
but lets explore another option

REGEXP operator:
this stands for regular expression
regular expressions are extremely powerful
when it comes to searching for strings they allow us to search for more
complex patterns 

With REGEXP we dont have to use the % in the string 
with REGEXP we have additional character that we do not have when we 
use the LIKE Operator like 

^: indicates the beginning of a string 
$: represents the end of a string 
|: used for multiple words (called logical all)
[]: depending on the location of the brackets the it will look for a combination of the characters inside of the brackets with the ones on the outside 
[a - z]: can also do range of characters 

Time to take this to the next level 
Lets say we want to find customers with the last names that include 
field, mac, and rose 

Another exercise let's say we wanted to find the customers that have
e in the last name we can use a simple REGEXP 

now lets say that we wanted to find a certian letter before the 
e?
we can prefix the string with [] and sql will check each letter with the e to see
if a customer matches 

We can also supply a range of characters
so using the [] we can check to see if there are any last names
with a-h that comes before e

There are plenty more special characters that SQL supports 
but honesty this the ones we used here are the main ones we will be using 

Exercise:
-- Get customers whose
-- First names are ELKA or AMBUR
-- last names end with EY or ON
-- last names start with MY or contains SE
-- last names contain B followed by R or U
