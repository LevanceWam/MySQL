This is the notes for AND OR NOT operators 

We are going to look at combining multiple search conditions
when we are filtering data.

AND Operator:
Lets say we want to get all of the customers born 
after jan 1, 1990 who also have more than 1000 points 
This is where we can use the AND operator
we can use this to write another condition to filter by

When we use this operator both of these conditions should be true 

OR operator:
Contrast to the AND operator if at least one of the conditions is
true, that row is returned in the result set

Now lets combine OR and AND operator 
to find customers who birthdate before jan 1, 1990 who also have more than 1000 points
and live in virginia

When we are combining multiple logical operators you need to be 
aware of the order of the operators 
just like order of operations in math we have a similar concept for these operators

The AND operator is always evavulated first so when this 
query is executed the execution engine first evalutes the condition
with AND first 

we can alway change the order using () 

NOT operator:
we use this to negate a condition
so we are going to prefix the query we had earlier and 
this query is going to return the customers opposite of the condition

to simply the query with out the use of the NOT operator
we can change the current operators to the opposite version 
so > becomes < and so on.

Exercise:
From the order_item table, get the items for order number 6
where the total price is greater than 30

solution notes:
To get the total price we need to multiply the quantity by the price
