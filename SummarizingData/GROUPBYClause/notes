this is the notes for GROUP BY Clause

in the last lecture we learned about aggeragate functions 
so we have a sum function that is returning the sum
of the records from the invoice_total column 

Now whay if we wanted to get the total sales per client 
This is where we need to group data by one or more columns

##GROUP BY:
So this is how this works
right after the FROM clause we use the 
GROUP BY clause and we type out one or more columns for grouping data
so we are going to groupn this by the client_id
now we cant see the client_id so we will add it next to the select clause

###Sorting the columns:
now by default data is sorted by the column specificed in our GROUP BY clause
but we can change the sort order using an order by clause

###filtering data:
we can apply a filter before grouping our data
so if we want to calculate the total sales by each client but for the second half of the year
we would use the where clause 

*important*
before we move on to grouping by multiple tables 
we need to pay attention to the order of the clauses
this is the current order
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
ORDER BY

GROUP BY always comes after the from and where clause and before the ORDER BY

##GROUPING BY multiple tables 
first we are going to join the invoices table with the client table 
now we are going to see the sales by state and city

since we are grouping by multiple columns 
we can see the total sales for each state 
and city combonation

so when we use multiple columns using the group by clause
we get one record for each city and state combonation

now in this example our data set we don't have 
nultiple cities per state 
but we are going to see that as part of the exercise

exercise:
we need to write a query that generates the screenshot report
we have 3 columns:
date
payment_method
total_payments

write this query against the payment table
