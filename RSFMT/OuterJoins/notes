This is the notes for Outer Joins 

In sql we have 2 kind of joins INNER and OUTER joins
So far we have used INNER joins 
also remember that we said that the inner keyword is optional
so when we type plain JOIN we are using a INNER JOIN

Now we are going to take a look at OUTER joins 
and the problems they solve

so we are going ti start with a basic inner then a outer one 

when we look at the records for the inner join 
we can see that we get a lot of customer_id dups
but we are missing something from our results

we only see the customers that have a order in the systems 
but in the customer table we have others that are not listed 
the reason they did not show up is because they do not have a order

Well what if we wanted to see all of the customers whether they had an order or not 
this is when we would use a outer join 

The reason why the inner join showed the customers with a order is because of the condition 
when we joined those 2 tables we are only returning 
records that match the condition
so for the given customer if they have a order they will be shown
so for the other customers that do not have a order they are not valid 

OUTER JOIN:
In sql we have 2 types of OUTER JOIN
we have left joins and right joins

LEFT JOIN:
when we use a left join all of the records from the left table in this case
the customers are returned whether the condition is true or not 
this will give us the customers and if they have an order then well see the 
order id too

now we can see the customers with out a order

RIGHT JOIN:
when we use a right join all of the records from the order table are returned 
whether the condition is true or false is returned 
this gives us all of the records from the order table

Intersting Note:
some developers will type out the keyword outer 
but this is optional just like inner 

Exercise:
Write a query that produces these 3 columns
product_id 
name
quantity from the order_items table 

so we need to join the products table with order items table 
-- we want all of the products from the products table 
even if there is a null somewhere
