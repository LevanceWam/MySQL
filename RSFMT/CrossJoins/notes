This is the notes for cross joins 

Lets take a look at cross joins 
we use cross joins to combine or join every record 
from the firsr table with every record in the second table 

so all we need to do is write the keyword CROSS followed by JOIN 
the table and that is all 
we do not need a condition

now when we execute this query
we are going to get the customers with a combination of all of the products 

A better example would be if we had a table of sizes
like small medium and large and a table of colors 
and we want to combine them

The current syntax we have is the explicit syntax for a cross join
we also have a implicit one 

the implicit one we just write the tables in the from clause 

Exercise:
do a cross join between shippers and products
one implicit
one explicit
