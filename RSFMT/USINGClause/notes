This is the notes for USING clause

back in the sql_store database we have a simple 
query that is joining the orders table and the customers table 

As the queries start to get more complex these conditions get in the way 
the make the queries hard to read

But, in sql we have a powerful feature 
that simplifies the queries if the column name 
is exactly the same across the 2 tables we can replace 
the ON clause with the USING clause which is simplier and 
shorter

USING Clause:
so we write the USING keyword out and place the column inside of parenthesis
we are going to do the same with the shippers table 
we can use a left join here so the USING clause 
works the same with outer joins 

However we cannot use this technique to join the
result with the order status table because in the order status table 
we have a column name status but in order status table 
this column has a different name 

The USING Clause only worka if the column name is the same across different tables 

Now what if there is multiple columns in our joint conditions
so like with the composite primary key in order items
so if we want to join this table with order items notes table 
In the join condition we should compare both of the conditions 
wih their corresponding columns in the order items notes table 

we are going to attempt this by using the USING keyword

Exercise:
In the sql_invoicing databae 
write a query to select the payments from the payments table and produce 
something like the report in the screenshots
the table has:
date 
client
amount 
name (shows payment method name)
