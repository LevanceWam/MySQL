This is the notes for self joins 

in sql we can also join a table with itself 

take a look at the sql_hr db
we only have 2 tables in here 
we are going to take the employee table 
and join it with itself so we can select the name of each 
employee and their manager

So doing a self join is pretty much the same thing as joining a table with another table 
the only difference:
    - have to use different aliases 
    - we have to prefix each column with a alias
