This is the notes for Self Outer Joins

earlier when we were talking about self joins 
we were working in the sql_hr database and we 
returned the manager that the employees reported to 

So we are going to work with these records again 
so we rewrite the old self join 

Now we are going to notice that we have something missing 
we sont have a record for the manager 
this is because of the inner join 

So we fix this with a left join
