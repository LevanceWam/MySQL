This is the notes for Joining across databases

Ther are going to be times where we are going to have to 
work with multiple databases

we are going to combine tables across multiple databases

we are going to combine the order_items table 
with the products table in sql_inventory (Its like the one in sql_store)

Now in order to get the product table after the join clause 
we are going to call the database and then the table that we want to use 

The reason that we have to prefix the database is because we are currently
within another database writing this query to get access to it 

Main thing to take from the lesson:
We only have to prefix the tables that are not 
apart of the current database 

The query will be different depending on the current db
