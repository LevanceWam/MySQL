This is the notes for joining multiple tables 

Going to take a look at joining multiple tables 
when a query

back in the sql_store DB
we now know how to join the order with the customers table to 
return info about a customer 
but we also have another column called status which is similar to the customer ID 
column

these status aere stored eslewhere and we want to get them
so if we look to order_statuses table 
we will see what status are 

Now we are going to want to write a query to join the 
orders table with 2 tables the customer and order_statuses

So first we write a normal join for combining 2 tables 
Now to add another table we can use another join

now in the real worls we are going ti be working on moree complex problems
that could require us to join 10 tables  

Exercise:

Inside of the sql invoicing database
we have a payments table that keeps track of clients payments toward a invoice
looking at the data we can see that there is a client id  this identifies the client so we canconnect this table 
next invoice id etc

Our task is to write a query to join the payment table to
to the payment_method and client table 

we need a report that shows the name of the client payment method and the payments
