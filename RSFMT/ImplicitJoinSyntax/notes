This is the notes for Implicit Join syntax

We are going to take a look at the Implicit Join
syntax in sql

we are starting off with a basic inner join 

Now there is another way to write this query using Implicit join syntax
all we have to do is call both of the tables next to the FROM clause 
and instead of using ON we use where
This behaves just like a basic inner join

But it is suggested that we dont use this because 
if we forget the WHERE clause this is going to be a cross join
