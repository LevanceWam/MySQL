This is the notes for Unions

In sql we can also combine rows from multiple tables
this is extremely powerful

we are going to take a look at this 
so we write a query to get all of the orders

What if we wanted to get all the orders next to eachother and add a label?

if the order is placed in the current year the label is going to be active 
and if the order was placed in previous years we want ti place it 
as archive

so we are going to change the query and add a condition
with this condition we ar getting orders from the current year

so we are going to pick the 2 columns we want and then we are going to use 
a string literal to label them as active we will call this column status

now we are going to make a query that is going to get the previous years
so we are going to copy the current query and modify it

but notice that we get a syntax error because we did not terminate the first select
but we are going to deal with this later 
now if we execute the query we are going to see that we are going to get 
more archived than active records 

UNION operator:

Now by using the UNION operator we can combine these 2 queries 
in between the 2 select statements 
now when we execute the query we are going to get the active and the archive recorswe 

we can use this operator to combine records from multiple queries

now for this example both of the queries are against the same table 
but we can also do this against other tables and combine the results 
in to one result set
so we are going to attempt that 

As we can see we get all of the customers and shippers in one colun 
Now there isn't really a real world use case for this particular query at the moment 

put we are going ti point out that with union we can combine result with multiple queries 
they can be from the same table or different 

but we need to rememeber that the number of columns that each query returns should be equal
otherwise we are going to get a error 

so if we write a query and the first table is returning 2 columns and the other one 
is returning 1 mysql doesn't know how to combine these records

One more important information 
when we look at the customer and shippers union 
the column is based on the first query so the first query
returns the first name and thats why this column is called first name 

if we change the order name would be the title of the column 
so whatever we have in the first query is going to be the name of the columns 

Exercise:
we need to write a query that is going to produce these columns 
customer_id, first_name, points, type

type is not going to be in the customers table 
so we calclated the values in this column based in the points 
each customer has if they have less than 2000 points then they get bronze
if they have between 2000 and 3000 silver 
greater than 3000 gold

they are also sorted by the first name
