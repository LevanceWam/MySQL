This is the notes for Natural joins 

In mysql we have another simpler way to join tables 
it is called a natural join and its easier to code 
but it is something that is not recommended 
because sometimes it can produce unexpected results 

But we will take a look just incase we see it somewhere

With natural joins we dont explicitly specify the column names
so the database on the common columns
The columns that have the same names and that is
the reason why this query is  shorted right

so when we execute the query it works 
coding with natural joins 
is really easy but they can be really risky

this is because we are letting the database engine figure out or
guess the join we do not have any control over it
for this very reason natural joins can produce unexpected results
