This is the notes for Compound Join Conditions

Up to this point we have been using a single column to unqiuely indenitfy the rows 
at the end of a table
like in the customer table when we use the customer id to unqiuely 
indenitfy the rows in this table 

But there are going to be times we can not use a single column to unqiuely indenitfy
records in a given table 

example
in order_items 
we can see that the order id column is repeated 
so we can not use this column by itself to unqiuely
indenitfy each record  the product id does the same 

so we could use the order_id and the product id 
to unqiuely indenitfy each order item

Now we are going to open up design mode for order_items
(The little wrench icon)
note that the yellow key represents the primary key exist 
on both of the columns
This is what we call a composite primary key

Composite primary key
composite primary key takes more then one column
why does this matter?
well when we have a table 
with a composite primary key 
we have to learn how to join that table with another table 

for example  in the order item notes table 
the column note_id unqiuely indenitfies the records in this 
table, next to that we have order id and product id
we know that these 2 columns unqiuely represents an order id

now we are going to join this table with ans order items table 
In sql_store

so we start by making a basic join to the order_id column
once this is done this is still not enough 
we need to make another Condition because this is a composite primary key
this is what we call a compound join Condition
we have multiple conditions to join the 2 tables
