this is the notes for outer joins between multiple tables 

Similar to inner joins we can combine multiple tables 
using outer joins 

we are using a example from a previous lecture where we were 
using a left join to get all of the customers that have a 
order table  whether the condition is true or not 

Looking into the customer table we also see that we have a shipper_id 
this is the orders that have been shipped 
now we are going to join the orders table with the shippers table to 
display the name of the shipper
and the result 

so first we tried to use a outer and a inner join this is 
possible 
but the we didnt recieve all of the records 
we got some of them 
so we are going to redo this query using a outer join instead of the inner

now earlier we learned that we can achieve the same results 
of a join by switching the order of a table 

However, 
As a best practice we want to avoid using right joins 
because when we are joining multiple tables 
and we have left and right and inner joins 
things can get really complex 

someone else that can look at our code might have a but of 
trouble visualizing how we are joining these 
table 

Exercise:
write a query that produces this result:
order_date
order_id
first_name
shipper
status 

we notice that some of the shipper names are null so we are going to need left joins
the tables we are going to need is:
customers 
orders
shippers
order_statuses 

Another note is that we are not returning all of the 
customers so we are using a inner join for customers and orders 
and we are also ordering it by the order_status name
