this is the notes for  Inserting Hierarchical rows

Now we are going to tackle inserting data into multiple tables
looking at the orders table we take a look at its column
and we notice that the items are not in this table

they are in the order item table 
this column has 4 tables the order id the product id
quantity and price 

so the actual order can have 1 or more order items 
this is what we call a parent child relationship

Parent child relationship:
so for this relationship the order table is the parent 
and the order item table is the child

so one row in the orders table can have one or more children inside of the 
order items table

now we aer going to take a look at how to insert an order in all these items so we 
are going to insert data into multiple tables 


when creating this order we need to make sure that the customer_id and the status 
match one of the records in the table sql will yell at us otherwise 

now that we inserted the order we need to insert the items 
but there is a interesting part 

As soon as we insert an order, mysql is going to generate 
an id for the new order we are going to need to access that id
in order to insert the items in this table 

this is how we do that 
in mysql we have a bunch of built-in functions 
in sql a function is a piece of code we can use 
the function we are going to use is called LAST_INSERT_ID

we can call or execute this function by adding parenthesis next to it 
this returns the id the mysql generates when we insert a new row

now we are going to use this function to insert the childs records 
so we write another insert statement for order_items 
since all of the columns are required we do not need to 
explictly pick any

next we add the values clause and for the order id we place the LAST_INSERT_ID function
to get the value
