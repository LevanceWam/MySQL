This is the notes for Inserting a Row 

Lets try inserting a row into a table 
for that we are going to use the 
INSERT INTO statement

INSERT INTO:
where are we going to insert the row 
in to a table of our choice 
followed by the values clause 
in the parenthesis we supply the values for 
every column in this table 

so if we take a look at the table definiton 
first we need to supply the value for 
customer_id column 
but remember that the auto increment is enabled so we don't supply 
a value mysql will generate a unique value for us 

so in the value parenthesis we can supply it with DEFAULT and it will generate the customer_id
now this is a best practice because if we where to set a explicit value 
it is possible we may have another customer with the same id 
and we can get a error we can not have duplicate values in this column 

after that we need to supply a value for the first name  and last name
note that we have to use strings when it comes to names and dates with ' or "

next birthdate which is optional or we can use a explicit value

NULL means the absence of a value 

next is phone  where this is another optional column so we can set NULL here
or use the DEFAULT which is also NULL

we then go to fill in the rest of the columns 

However in this example we are only supplying values for 
first and last name, birthdate, and the address fields
so we are missing the phone, id, and points 

so there is another way to write this statement

so after the table name we can optionally supply the list of columns that
we want to insert values into 

in this case all of the columns we provided values for earlier 

now when we execute the query 
we can check the action  output and see that a record was added into the table 
and when we look at the customer table the new customer is there and sql added the id for us
by incrementing the id from the last customer
