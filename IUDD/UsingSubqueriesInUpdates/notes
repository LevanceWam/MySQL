This is the notes for Using Subqueries in Updates

We are going to use a update query in a update statement 
so going off of the last example from the prevoius lecture

lets say we didnt have the id of the client 
but we had the name 

for example we have a application where the user only types in the name of the
client
this is going to make us find the id for that client
then we are going to use that to find the id and update all of the invoices

How can we approach this?
IN the clients table 
we are going to pick the name and find the id
we are going to write a select statement to return the id

Now we can use this SELECT statement as a subquery
remember a subquery is a SELECT statement that is used within another SQL statement

so instead of hard coding the 3 we are going to use the select statement as a subquery
but this is important we have to wrap the SELECT statement in parenthesis 
so MySQL will execute this query first

we will get the client id first and then use it in the condition

Now what if this query returned multiple clients
in the clients table 
what if we wanted to update all the invoices for all of the clients 
located in new york or california

since the subquery is returning multople records we can not use the equal sign anymore 
it needs to be replace with the in operator

as a best practice always check to see what records the subquery is going to update
this stops us from accidently updating records that shouldnt be updated

in the current example we are using a subquery to update the records
but even if we didnt have a subquery we can still
query the records
lets test this out  

so lets say we want to update the invoices where the payment dates are null 
before executing the entire update statement 
we should run the query that returns the result that we want

once we know that the query is the one we are looking for we can just use the where clause and the 
update statement 

Exercise:
In sql_store database
in the orders table 
some of the orders dont have a comment 

write a SQL statement to:
update the comments for orders of customers more than 3000
customers that have more than 3000 regard them as gold customers 
find the order if they have placed an order 
update the comments column and set it to gold customer
