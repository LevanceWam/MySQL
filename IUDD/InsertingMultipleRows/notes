This is the notes for inserting multiple rows

Lets try to insert multiple rows in one go
for this demo we are going to use the shippers table 

so for this table's definition we have 2 columns id and name 
shipper id is primary and canot be null it can be auto incremented

then there is name it can not be null

to insert multiple rows all we have to do is 
write the insert query like we did earlier and then
we use a coma and another parenthesis to add another value 

now we can execute the query ans see that the new 
records have been added and their ids were added for us

Exercise:
We are going to write a statement to:
Insert 3 rows in the product table 

interesting note!
if we were to delete records we made and insert them again 
they wouldn't have the same ids 
mysql remembers the last stored id and increments from there
