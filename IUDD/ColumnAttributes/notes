This is the notes for  Column attributes

In this section we are going to learn how to insert update and delete data
but before we do that we are going to take a closer look at the customer table

so we are open it in design mode which we can do by clicking the wrench
by the table 

On the left we have the column name 

next is the datatype for each column 
so things like the customer_id column can only accept intergers 
intergers are whole numbers no decimals

first_name is a varchar which is short for 
variable character in the parenthesis next to it is the maximum amount of 
characters but we do not have to use all of it 

we do have another datatype called character
it the maximum was 50 and we only had 5 characters
mysql will insert an additional 45 spaces to fill the column 

so as best practice use var char

to the right of the datatypes column 
we can see pk which is short for primary key 
so we can see that customer_id is marked with a primary key and that is why 
it has the yellow key next to it 
so the values in this column unqiuely identify each customer 

next to that we have nn which is short for not null 
and this determines if this column can accept 
null values or not so in this cases every customer record must have a customer_id 
first_name and so on. but birthdate and phone are optional
in these columns we can have null values 

we have another column which is called ai which is short for auto increment 
and this is often used with primary key columns 
so everytime we insert a new record in the table we let 
mysql or our database engine insert a value in this column
so it essentially get the customer id for the last row 
and it will increment it by 1 at the time we insert a new record

so if we were to add another customer to the table mysql will asign 11 to the 
new customer 

the last column is where we can specify the default value for each column 
so for birthdate and phone columns will be null if we do not supply a value 
we also have one for points it will be set to zero if  we do not supply anything 

we will look into the other columns at a later time
