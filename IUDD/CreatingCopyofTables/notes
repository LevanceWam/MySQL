this is the notes for creating a copy of a table 

Lets try copying data from one table to another 
heres an example 
in the orders table currently we have about a dozen records
and we want to copy this table and we want to insert every row
that we have into the new table 

we are going to use a powerful techinque to quickly copy 
data from one table to another 

first we need to create the new table
this is where we use the CREATE TABLE statement 

CREATE TABLE:
after the create statement we are going to select everything from the 
orders table 

now when we execute the query we can see that a new table 
was created and it has the exact same columns as the order table 

but if we open this in design mode 
we notice that we do not have a primary key
so the order id column is not marked as a primary key 
and it is not marked as a auto increment column 

so when we create a table using this technique sql will 
ignore these attributes and that means if we want to 
explicitly insert a record into this new table 
have to supply a value or order id 

because this column is no longer an auto increment column 
okay so using the CREATE TABLE _____ AS statement quickly creates a copy of a table 

the select statement is referred to as a sub query 

Sub Query:
is a select statement that is part of another sql statement
we can use a sub query in a insert statement and that is a powerful techinque

Lets try it out
first we need to truncate table this is going to delete all of the data in the table 
this is faster than a regular delete (interview question)

now if we wanted to copy a subset of records from the 
orders table into this table 

like all of the orders placed before 2019
so we write a simple query to get all of the 
records before 2019 
once we have that above the query we put the insert statement 
we are not going to supply values for the columns 
because we are copying it over 

Exercise:
In sql_invoicing 
in the invoices table 
we have the columns:
invoice_id
number 
client_id which is related to the client table followed by some other columns 

so lets say we want to make a copy of this table 
into a new table called archive 
however instead of the client id column we want to have the 
name column 

we are going to have to join this table with the clients table then 
use the query as a subquery in a create table statement 
and we only want to copy the invoices that have a have a payment 

Breakdown:
Use create table called invoice_archive using a  subquery
join the invoices and client table 
only copy the invoices with a payment 
get the client name column instead of the client id 

as a quick note!
if we try to execute a table that is already created we are going to get a error
