This is the notes for Updating a Single Row

We are going to update some data in sql
in invoices we can see that the payment total for the 
first record is 0 and there is no payment date

lets say that the client made a payment for this invoice so we should update 
this record in the table

UPDATE:
This is a job for the update statement 
this statement will update one or more records in a table 

so we call the table that we want and then use the SET clause
SET:
this is where we specify the value for one or more columns 
after we choose which columns to update and to update multiple columns we seperate columns 
with comas (,)

then we use the where statement to choose which record we want to apply the update to

Now lets say that we updated the wrong invoice number
so we should update the table one more time and restore the record that we changed

so we need to undo invoice_id 1 and update invoice_id 3
