this is the notes for updating multiple rows

In the last lecture we learned how to update a single row
to update multiple rows we do the same thing  
but the condition we type out usng the where clause has to be
more general

for example in the invoices table  we can see that we have multiple 
invoices for client number 3 

we can write a statement to update all of the invoices for this client 

however if we execute this statement with mysql workbench
we are going to get an error.
this is because by default mysql workbench is in the safe update mode 
so it only allows us to update a single record

this problem will go away if we use another client from mysql workbench
or if we write this statement in the application code 
this is only specific to mysql workbench

So lets see how to get around this 

In the preferences of sql workbench
untick the last option at the bottom of the menu
this prevents us from accidently updating or deleting 
a bunch of records in a table 

now we need to reconnect to this instance of sql
now we can execute the query

we can also use the IN operator to get multiple clients
and by the way we can use all of the operators that can be used with the where clause

also the where clause is optional so if we wanted to update all of the 
records in the table we just leave it out 

Exercise:
Write a SQL statement to:
give any customer born before 1990
